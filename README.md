# Validator for Architecture Models with Structurizr (vams)

This tools allows archture models described with the [structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl) to analysed an validation checks to be performed on them.

The build-in checks are a bit opinionated, so expect to adapt the code to your validation needs.

A use of a plug-in mechanism is a potential future extension.
